## About

This project is a custom-built Python application developed for an insurance brokerage company. The company needed an intuitive tool to process receipt data and verify whether insurance companies were paying the correct commission amounts to the brokerage.

In this business context, insurance policyholders pay premiums to insurance companies, and the companies pay brokers a percentage of those premiums. This percentage depends on the product and the age (seniority) of the policy. 

**Challenges faced:**  
- The brokerage‚Äôs internal database was incomplete, lacking the theoretical commission percentages for many insurance products.
- Some policies had historically agreed reduced commissions, but the database did not reliably record this information.
- One insurance company had underpaid commissions for several years. Although this issue had already been resolved, the brokerage needed to ensure similar discrepancies wouldn't happen again.

**What this application does:**  
1. **Processes receipt data** exported in a specific Excel format generated by the company's management software.  
2. **Cross-references** this data with the brokerage‚Äôs internal database to verify commission correctness.  
3. **Detects** receipts with underpais commissions and **flags** products with missing or suspicious data.  
4. **Generates three Excel reports:**
   - ‚úÖ **Correct Receipts Report**: Lists receipts where the brokerage received the expected commission.  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Receipts to Review Report**: Lists receipts where the brokerage received a **lower commission than expected**, based on theoretical values in the database.
   - üìä **Statistical Summary Report**: Provides aggregate statistics per product, comparing the average commission actually received with the theoretical commission in the database. Products with a significant deviation are highlighted, helping the company **detect errors or outdated data in their commission records**.

## Data Science Aspects  

This project showcases multiple data science and analytics capabilities:  
- üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing, incomplete, and erroneous data from real-world sources.
- üîÄ Data Integration: Merging and aligning data from different systems (receipts vs. internal commission tables).
- üìà Descriptive Statistics & Outlier Detection: Computing and comparing average commissions, highlighting products with significant anomalies.
- üìä Automated Reporting: Producing detailed Excel files for operational decision-making and auditing.
- üß† Decision Support: Helping the brokerage prioritize database corrections and detect systemic issues in commission payments.  

## Requirements 

This project is written in Python 3.11 and uses a graphical interface built with **tkinter**.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Although tkinter is part of the Python standard library, in newer Python versions (e.g., 3.13), it may not work correctly on some systems (especially macOS and Linux) due to missing GUI support or compatibility issues. Therefore, this project explicitly requires Python 3.11, where it has been tested and verified to work.

## Instructions

### 1.Cloning the repositories  
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/castrogr/aplicativo.git
```
### 2.Executing  
```shell
$ cd claimer_source_code
$ python3 claim.py
```
### 3. Tester. 
The app will ask you to open the files to process. <br>
	1. "Abra el archivo excel a evaluar": use testfile.xlsx <br>
 	2. "Cargue el archivo de los recibos reclamados de Cosesa": use testcosesa.xlsx
### 4. Saving the results
Once processed, you can save the results files, one contains the statistic data with the marked discrepancies, another contains the recietps in wich the commission paid is lower that the agreed and the amount to claim. And the last one contains the reciepts that were paid according to agreed commission


NOTE: The application and the Documentation are in spanish as the client was spanish, I will update the documentation in english soon
