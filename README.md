# DESKTOP APP - CLAIMER

## About

This project is a custom-built Python application developed for an insurance brokerage company. The company needed an easy-to-use tool to process receipt data and verify if the payments made by insurance companies to the brokerage were accurate.

Insurance policyholders pay the insurance premium to the insurance companies, and these companies, in turn, pay a commission percentage of the premium to the brokers. This percentage varies depending on the insurance product and the seniority of the policy.  

**Challenges faced:**  
- The brokerage’s database had incomplete information, including missing commission percentage data for many products.
- Some policies had reduced commissions agreed upon years ago between brokers and policyholders, but this information was also partially missing.
- One insurance company had been underpaying commissions for several years. Brokers detected this discrepancy, claimed the difference, and it was eventually settled.

**What this application does:**  
1. Processes the receipt information — specifically in the **Excel format generated by the company’s management software**, meaning the input data structure is tailored to this project.
2. Creates detailed lists of products appearing in the receipts, with statistical insights.
3. Identifies discrepancies such as missing commission data or policies with reduced commissions, flagging them for database update.
4. Cross-references claimed and regularized receipts with the brokerage database.

## Requirements 

This project is written in Python language and thus needs the Python3 interpreter. It also uses the following modules: Pandas, requests, XlsxWriter and openpylx

## Instructions

### 1.Cloning the repositories  
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/castrogr/aplicativo.git
```
### 2.Executing  
```shell
$ cd claimer_source_code
$ python3 claim.py
```
### 3. Tester. 
The app will ask you to open the files to process. <br>
	1. "Abra el archivo excel a evaluar": use testfile.xlsx <br>
 	2. "Cargue el archivo de los recibos reclamados de Cosesa": use testcosesa.xlsx
### 4. Saving the results
Once processed, you can save the results files, one contains the statistic data with the marked discrepancies, another contains the recietps in wich the commission paid is lower that the agreed and the amount to claim. And the last one contains the reciepts that were paid according to agreed commission


NOTE: The application and the Documentation are in spanish as the client was spanish, I will update the documentation in english soon
